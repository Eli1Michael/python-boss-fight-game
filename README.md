# Final Boss Python Game
A small text-based boss battle game I built while learning Python.
It uses variables, loops, conditionals, and randomness to simulate a fight
between the player and a powerful boss.
---

# Features
- Player attacks, blocks, heals, and can use a super move
- Stamina affects how strong actions are
- Random damage (boss and player can miss)
- Boss can stagger
- Game ends with multiple possible outcomes
---

# Requirements
- Python 3.9+ (anything recent should work)
---

# How to Run
1. Download the project
2. Open a terminal in the folder
3. Run:The_Boss_Battle.py
---

# How it works (short explanation)
- Variables store player and boss stats
- 'while' loop keeps the fight running
- 'if / elif / else' handle choices and results
- 'random' decides hit/miss and damage amounts
- Health, stamina, and super meter update every turn
---

# What I Learned
- Designing game logic step by step
- Debugging broken logic instead of giving up
- Using randomness to make games feel alive
- Thinking like a programmer, not just typing code

This is my first real Python project — more improvements coming later 🙂
